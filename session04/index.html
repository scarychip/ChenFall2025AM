        <h2>What is a mushroom?</h2>
        <h3>Mushroom is...</h3>
        <p>
                A mushroom is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus,typically produced above ground on soil or another food source. A toadstool generally refers to a poisonous mushroom.

The standard for the name <span class ="mushroom">"MUSHROOM"</span> is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word <span class ="mushroom">"MUSHROOM"</span> is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. <span class ="mushroom">"MUSHROOM"</span> also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.
            </p>
        <blockquote>
      Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as "bolete", "truffle", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales.

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
       <p>
           The terms <span class ="mushroom">"mushroom"</span> and "toadstool" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms <span class = "underline"> mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron,</span> or <span class = "underline">musserouns</span> were used.</p>

        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>
            Identifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is useful in both classifying and identifying mushrooms. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.</p>
