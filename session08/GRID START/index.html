      <h2>GETTING STARTED WITH ROCK CLIMBING</h2>
      <p>Rock climbing provides a unique, physical outlet that anyone can enjoy. Learning to move up the wall creates a strong mind-body connection that can help build self-awareness and confidence. Climbing is also a great way to build fitness, make new friends and spend time outside.</p>
      <p>At first glance, it may seem intimidating; specialized gear and technical skills can feel like big barriers to accessing the sport. Luckily, there are so many ways to enjoy rock climbing. Indoor gyms make it possible to try it out close to home, and most gyms set up routes in a wide range of difficulty, including plenty that are suitable for beginners. And if you want to head outside, there are countless organizations and guiding companies that offer introductory classes.</p>
      <h2>Step 1: Understand Climbing Disciplines</h2>
      <p>Rock climbing has a broad range of disciplines, with each requiring differing types of gear and training. Maybe you've seen pictures of climbers hanging from ropes hundreds of feet above the ground. While this is one way to engage with the sport, there are several forms of climbing that keep you much closer to earth. As a beginner, some of the best places to start are top-rope climbing (top-roping) or bouldering, either indoors or outside.</p>
      <h3>Bouldering</h3>
      <p>Bouldering requires the least amount of specialized gear and technical knowledge to get started. Though a few advanced climbs can get pretty high, most bouldering routes—often referred to as "problems"—take you only as high as you can jump off comfortably. Bouldering is a great introductory activity because it requires only climbing shoes, a chalk bag, a crash pad (to cushion your jump or fall off the rock), and experienced spotters to help guide your landing. You don't need a rope, a harness or other hardware.</p>
      <h3>Top-rope climbing</h3>
      <p>Top-rope climbing (or top-roping) brings you higher off of the ground than bouldering and uses a rope for protection. The climber ties into one end of a rope that passes through an anchor at the top of the route. As the climber ascends, another person, called the "belayer," uses a belay device to take in slack on the other end of the rope. By keeping the rope taut, the belayer minimizes the fall distance if the climber slips. Belaying is a critical role, and you can learn how to belay in many introductory climbing classes.</p>
      <h3>More advanced climbing</h3>
      <p>After gaining comfort with top-roping or bouldering, you may be curious to learn more about sport lead climbing or traditional lead climbing. These skills are often necessary for outdoor roped climbing without a guide or more experienced climber.</p>
