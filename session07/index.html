                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>Hypomyces lactifluorum, or the lobster mushroom, is a parasitic ascomycete fungus that grows on certain species of mushrooms, turning them a reddish orange color that resembles the outer shell of a cooked lobster. The fungus is edible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Contrary to its common name, the species itself is neither a lobster nor a mushroom.
H. lactifluorum specifically attacks members of the genera Lactarius and Lactifluus (milk-caps), as well as Russula (brittlegills), such as Russula brevipes and Lactifluus piperatus in North America. At maturity, the reddish orange H. lactifluorum thoroughly covers its host, rendering it unidentifiable As it ages, its color can go from the entire sporocarp surface and lamella to the margin of the mushroom.

The species produces a white spore print.

Russula olympiana appears in many western North American field guides as "Russula xerampelina."</p>

                    <h3>Uses</h3>
                    <p>Lobster mushrooms are widely eaten and enjoyed freshly foraged and cooked. They are commercially marketed and sometimes found in grocery stores; they have been made available at markets in Oregon.[7] They have a seafood-like flavor and a firm, dense texture.[citation needed]
While edible, field guides note the hypothetical possibility that H. lactifluorum could parasitize a toxic host and that individuals should avoid consuming lobster mushrooms with unknown hosts, although no instances of toxicity have been recorded. During the course of infection, the chemicals get converted into other more flavorful compounds, making lobster mushrooms more edible. Lactarius piperatus has a spicy, hot flavor but that flavor is counteracted by the parasite H. lactifluorum, making it more edible and delicious. One author notes that he has personally never experienced any trouble from consuming them and another notes that there have been no reports of poisoning in hundreds of years of consumption.[9]</p>

                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Hypomyces lactifluorum is found in wooded areas, often near Russula brevipes or Lactarius growing in conifer forests, in particular under ponderosa pine in the American Southwest and the Pacific Northwest. Its range in the woods has been described as "solitary, scattered or gregarious" depending on location.</p>
