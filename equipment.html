			<h2>Gear Needed for Rock Climbing
</h2>
			<p>If you start out at a gym or climb with a guide, necessary equipment is usually provided. Some gyms or guides might require you to buy at least a few pieces of gear, though. And, eventually, you'll want a full set of your own climbing gear.
<br>
<span class="bold">Tip:.</span>  Always inspect your gear before climbingâ€”whether you own it or rent it. Frequent use inevitably results in some wear and tear. The advantage of buying your own gear is that you know its history.</p>
			<p> <span class="bold">For indoor bouldering, all you need are comfortable clothes, climbing shoes and chalk.</span> 
</p>
			<h3>Climbing Clothes:</h3>
			<p>Wear clothing that allows you to move freely on the wall. Choose clothing that is breathable, wicks sweat and dries fast so that you can stay warm and comfortable while climbing. If you're climbing outdoors, carry extra clothes for changing conditions just as you would for hiking.</p>
			<H3>Rock Climbing Shoes:</H3>
			<p>Climbing shoes protect your feet while providing the friction you need to grip footholds. Some styles are quite versatile, but your climbing ability and where you climb are factors in choosing the right shoe for you. Rock shoes should fit snugly but not painfully tight. The general rule is that closer-fitting shoes are better for more technically challenging climbs. Learn more on how to choose rock climbing shoes or check out our staff's favorite climbing shoes.</p>
			<h3>Chalk:</h3>
			<p>Just like gymnasts, climbers use chalk to improve their grip. Chalk absorbs perspiration on your hands. Climbers often carry chalk in a chalk bag slung from the waist by a lightweight belt. Be sure to check the rules at your local gym or crag; some areas don't allow chalk or require that climbers only use certain types. </p>
			<p><span class="bold">For top-roping,</span> in addition to climbing shoes, chalk and comfortable clothes, you'll also need a climbing harness, locking carabiner and belay device. If you're climbing outside, a helmet designed specifically for climbing is an essential tool.</p>
			<h3>Carabiners:</h3>
			<p>These strong, light metal rings with spring-loaded gates have endless applications in climbing systems. For most beginners, the first carabiner you'll buy is a locking carabiner designed to be used with a belay device. </p>
